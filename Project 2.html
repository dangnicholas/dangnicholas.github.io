                        <h2 style="color: #434d3b;">Project Summary</h2>
                        <p style="color: #434d3b;">This project was a class project for CS 2400 Intro to AI where we chose<br>our own AI algorithm to research about and present to the class. Our task<br>included preparing a 15-minute presentation as well as a code demo of the<br>Hidden Markov Model which we would demonstrate how the model worked using an<br>example scenario for it.<br></p>
                        <p style="color: #434d3b;">The final deliverable<br>was the code of the Hidden Markov Model which we modified from a website and<br>the PowerPoint that we presented with. This project consisted of 2 weeks of<br>research, implementation, and practice presenting. Time was a constraint in<br>this project since we couldn’t get too in depth in the material and create the<br>whole model from scratch which led us to use a hmm library in python. This lab<br>was a pair project which helped in being able to cover more material that<br>wouldn’t be possible to if it was an individual lab. My role in this included<br>half the presentation and half the code demo which was implemented by both of<br>us.<br></p>
                        <h2 style="color: #434d3b;">Project Analysis</h2>
                        <p style="color: #434d3b;">Things I did well in this lab included having an informative presentation with good discussion, examples, and reasons that the model would be used in a scenario. I also believe the presentation was structured nicely so that people could follow the presentation without much issue. This included having the explanation and terms associated with this Hidden Markov Model were toward the beginning so that when the code demo was reached, things would make more sense on how the ideas used to create a HMM (Hidden Markov Model) were implemented in code. I also think I did well in collaborating with my partner since we both were able to finish our portions<br>of work in a timely manner which allowed us to have more time to practice the<br>presentation. I was able to learn about Hidden Markov Models which I didn’t<br>know about before this project as well as get more practice with Python which<br>included using libraries such as NumPy. From the content learned in the class,<br>I also was able to fit training data to the model and evaluate the<br>effectiveness of each training set. I also got more practice with formatting the<br>code to be presentable and walking through a code implementation which included<br>what each variable was, what outputs represented, and what libraries were used.<br>Improvements I could make for my next project based from this would be to<br>create a git project to be able to have the code collaboration asynchronous if<br>we need to. I would also organize my code more nicely to be well documented and<br>some functions placed in appropriate methods.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
