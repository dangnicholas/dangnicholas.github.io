                    <p style="color: #434d3b;">This project was a MSOE quarter long project for SE 2800 which was Software Engineering Process I which included 4 other classmates where we had to build an application which would work like MSOE Scheduler. Some differences included uploading your transcript to help so that the application could build an example graduation plan as well as recommending some classes to take based on the quarter and your completed classes.</p>
                    <p style="color: #434d3b;">The final deliverable was a working application that we could present to the class to show the features we implemented into it such as the completed import transcript implementation and correct graduation plan. Some constraints that came from this project included difficulty in merging branches back into master using Git and difficulty reaching some group members to complete certain tasks that others were waiting on. My role within this project was implementing the prerequisites class which would handle MSOE’s prerequisites file as well as having appropriate methods for others to use. I also implemented the graduation&nbsp;plan based on courses taken.<br></p>

                    <h2 id="Project-Analysis" style="font-size: 30px;">Project Analysis</h2>
                    <p style="color: #434d3b;">From doing this project, I felt like I was able to consistently communicate with my group members to divide work up evenly. I also made sure that all my assigned issues were completed fully or to a working level within a sprint. This project taught me a lot about the Scrum process and working with a group to implement an application. I was able to use more features in GitLab from this such as documenting our sprints in the wiki, creating new sprints, creating an issue board, and logging time worked on an issue. I also got more experience with some things that I had trouble with such as creating new branches and merging them back to master branch. I also got to get more practice with writing test cases for my code implementations using Junit testing. Lastly, this lab was the first lab where I used Scene builder to create the fxml file instead of writing it from scratch which improved the UX design of the application as we had an easier&nbsp;time in designing the layout of the application.<br></p>
                    <p style="color: #434d3b;">Things that went well in this project included documenting my code well so that other group members could use my code without having too much difficulty in figuring out what it does. Some improvements I would make for my next project from this include better collaboration and communication with group members so that we could make sure that everyone is doing good since my group had some issues where 2 of our group members were having trouble implementing their code and needed help but waited until we had very little time.<br></p>
