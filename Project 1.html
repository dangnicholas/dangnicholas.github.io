                        <p style="color: #434d3b;">This project was a MSOE quarter long project for SE 2800 which was<br>Software Engineering Process I which included 4 other classmates where we had<br>to build an application which would work like MSOE Scheduler. Some differences included uploading your transcript to help so that the application could build an<br>example graduation plan as well as recommending some classes to take based on<br>the quarter and your completed classes.<br></p>
                        <p style="color: #434d3b;">The final deliverable was a working application that we could present to<br>the class to show the features we implemented into it such as the completed<br>import transcript implementation and correct graduation plan. Some constraints<br>that came from this project included difficulty in merging branches back into<br>master using Git and difficulty reaching some group members to complete certain<br>tasks that others were waiting on. My role within this project was implementing<br>the prerequisites class which would handle MSOE’s prerequisites file as well as<br>having appropriate methods for others to use. I also implemented the graduation<br>plan based on courses taken.<br></p>

                        <p style="color: #434d3b;">From doing this project, I felt like I was able to consistently communicate with my group members to divide work up evenly. I also made sure that all my assigned issues<br>were completed fully or to a working level within a sprint. This project taught<br>me a lot about the Scrum process and working with a group to implement an<br>application. I was able to use more features in GitLab from this such as documenting<br>our sprints in the wiki, creating new sprints, creating an issue board, and<br>logging time worked on an issue. I also got more experience with some things that<br>I had trouble with such as creating new branches and merging them back to<br>master branch. I also got to get more practice with writing test cases for my<br>code implementations using Junit testing. Lastly, this lab was the first lab<br>where I used Scene builder to create the fxml file instead of writing it from<br>scratch which improved the UX design of the application as we had an easier<br>time in designing the layout of the application. Things that went well in this<br>project included documenting my code well so that other group members could use<br>my code without having too much difficulty in figuring out what it does. Some<br>improvements I would make for my next project from this include better<br>collaboration and communication with group members so that we could make sure<br>that everyone is doing good since my group had some issues where 2 of our group<br>members were having trouble implementing their code and needed help but waited<br>until we had very little time.<br></p>
